\usage{
update_product_list_from_html(html_txt)
}
\arguments{
\item{html_txt}{Text to include in project list, as HTML element containing product entries as \verb{<a>} elements.}
}

}
\details{
Steps to create local products list file:
\enumerate{
\item Go to:
\itemize{
\item \url{https://plus.nl/eerder-gekochte-producten} for personal, previously purchased products
\item \url{https://www.plus.nl/producten} for all products
\item \url{https://www.plus.nl/zoekresultaten?SearchTerm=YOURSEARCHTERM} to search for products
}
\item Scroll down as far as you like to load more products
\item Open the Web Info panel and copy a high-level HTML element to the clipboard (so that all \verb{<a>} elements of products are contained within)
\item Run:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{html_txt <- clipr::read_clip()
new_product_list <- update_product_list_from_html(html_txt)

# this is the local filepath for products (the R package does not contain product data)
path <- file.path(shinyplus:::plus_env$data_dir, "product_list.rds")

# make a backup
file.copy(from = path, to = paste0(path, ".", format(Sys.time(), "\%Y\%m\%d-\%H\%M\%S"), ".bak"))

# save new product list
saveRDS(new_product_list, path)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}

Alternatively, visit the relevant tab in the \code{\link[=shinyplus]{shinyplus()}} app.

This process can be repeated as often as needed.

\section{Disclaimer}{



This open-source R package, \emph{shinyplus}, is an independent software project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated in any way with PLUS Retail B.V. or the website \href{https://www.plus.nl}{plus.nl}.

The package does \strong{not} contain or store any data from plus.nl. It contains \strong{no product information, pricing data, or content} originating from PLUS Retail B.V. or its systems. Users are required to provide their own data (e.g., product lists) manually.

All interactions with plus.nl occur through \strong{local, client-side browser automation}, using the \href{https://rstudio.github.io/chromote/}{\code{chromote}} package. This mechanism emulates a user operating a private browser session on their own machine. For example, when a user submits a basket to their PLUS shopping cart, this package simply opens a browser in the background and automates user-visible steps — such as logging in, navigating to product pages, and clicking buttons — exactly as a person would. No API calls or server-side data access is used or implied.

Any logos, icons, or brand references (e.g., the PLUS logo) used in the user interface are publicly available media assets sourced from \href{https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLUS_(Nederlandse_supermarkt)}{Wikipedia} under appropriate free-use licensing.
