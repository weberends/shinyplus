#' This open-source R package, *shinyplus*, is an independent software project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated in any way with PLUS Retail B.V. or the website [plus.nl](https://www.plus.nl).
#'
#' The package does **not** contain or store any data from plus.nl. It contains **no product information, pricing data, or content** originating from PLUS Retail B.V. or its systems. Users are required to provide their own data (e.g., product lists) manually.
#'
#' All interactions with plus.nl occur through **local, client-side browser automation**, using the [`chromote`](https://rstudio.github.io/chromote/) package. This mechanism emulates a user operating a private browser session on their own machine. For example, when a user submits a basket to their PLUS shopping cart, this package simply opens a browser in the background and automates user-visible steps — such as logging in, navigating to product pages, and clicking buttons — exactly as a person would. No API calls or server-side data access is used or implied.
#'
#' Any logos, icons, or brand references (e.g., the PLUS logo) used in the user interface are publicly available media assets sourced from [Wikipedia](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLUS_(Nederlandse_supermarkt)) under appropriate free-use licensing. All trademarks, service marks, and product names are the property of their respective owners.
