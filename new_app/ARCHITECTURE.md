# ShinyPLUS → Python: Technical Architecture

## What This Is

A personal Dutch grocery planning app. Users plan weekly meals, manage a recipe/dish database, and send a shopping basket to their PLUS.nl online supermarket cart. The current version is R/Shiny. This document describes the Python rewrite in progress.

## PLUS.nl Integration (the hard part — now solved)

PLUS.nl runs on **OutSystems**, a low-code platform. There is no public API. Their web frontend is a React SPA calling internal `screenservices` endpoints.

### Login

OAuth2 browser flow via `aanmelden.plus.nl` (`client_id=web_ecop_eprod`). Unavoidable — requires a real browser. Implemented with **Playwright** (Python, headless Chromium). Takes ~20s once per session.

After login, all subsequent operations are direct HTTP calls via `page.evaluate(fetch(...))`. No browser navigation or DOM interaction.

### Direct API calls (post-login)

All operations are `POST` requests to `https://www.plus.nl/screenservices/`. Cart actions are under `ECP_Cart_CW`; promotions are under `ECP_Composition_CW`:

**Cart** — `ECP_Cart_CW/`:

| Operation | Endpoint | Key parameters |
|---|---|---|
| Add item | `ActionCheckoutItem_Add` | `SKU`, `QuantityToAdd`, `CheckoutId`, `CheckoutVersion` |
| Remove item | `ActionCheckoutItem_Remove` | `SKU`, `LineItemId`, `QuantityToRemove`, `CheckoutId`, `CheckoutVersion` |
| Read cart | `DataActionGetCartById` | `CheckoutId` |
**Promotions** — `ECP_Composition_CW/Promotions/Promotion_LP_Content_TF_Optimization/` and `ECP_Promotion_CW/PromotionDetailsFlow/PromotionOffer_DP_Content/`:

| Operation | Endpoint | Key parameters |
|---|---|---|
| All deals, all categories | `DataActionGetPromotionList_Optimization` | `StoreNumber`, `UserStoreId`, `OneWelcomeUserId`, `IsNextWeekPromotions` |
| Products behind a group deal | `DataActionPromotionOfferDetail_Get` | `PromotionOfferId` (slug), `StoreNumber`, `CheckoutId` |

`DataActionGetPromotionList_Optimization` uses `screenData.variables` (OutSystems screen data action) rather than `inputParameters`. One call returns all 17 category sections (~148 offers) for the full week. `IsNextWeekPromotions: true` switches to next week. The `EmptyListItem` type schema for `LocalPromotionList` must be sent verbatim (hardcoded constant `_PROMO_EMPTY_ITEM` in `client.py`).

`DataActionPromotionOfferDetail_Get` is called on-demand with a promotion `slug` (e.g. `"4431-96"`) and returns the individual products qualifying for that group deal — name, SKU, subtitle, image, original price, and per-product deal label. Note `StoreChannelD` (trailing D) in this payload, distinct from `StoreChannel` in the promotions list payload.

**Speed:** ~400ms per call (vs 20–30s in the R/Chromote version, and no double-add bugs).

### Authentication for API calls

Each screenservices call requires three things beyond the payload:
- **Session cookies** from the browser login (passed automatically via `page.evaluate(fetch(...), credentials: 'include')`)
- **`x-csrftoken` header** — the `crf=` field parsed from the `nr2Users` cookie
- **`outsystems-locale: nl-NL` header**

### The versioning problem (OutSystems-specific)

Every request body must include `versionInfo.moduleVersion` and `versionInfo.apiVersion`. These are **action-specific hashes baked into PLUS.nl's compiled JavaScript** — different for Add vs Remove vs GetCart. If stale, the server returns `hasApiVersionChanged: true` and an empty response.

**Solution:** Discover them once via a browser-intercepted request, then **cache to disk** (`~/.config/shinyplus/api_versions.json`). Valid until PLUS.nl deploys a new version. On `hasApiVersionChanged: true`, cache is automatically invalidated and the next session re-discovers them.

### How versions are discovered (first session only)

1. Navigate to a product search page, click the add-to-cart button once → browser JS fires `ActionCheckoutItem_Add` with the correct `apiVersion` → intercepted by Playwright's `page.on("request")` → saved to cache
2. Navigate to cart, click quantity badge to open the `±` slider, click the remove button → browser JS fires `ActionCheckoutItem_Remove` → intercepted → saved to cache

This two-click setup happens exactly **once ever** (until PLUS.nl redeploys). All subsequent sessions load from cache.

### LineItemId

Each cart item has a server-assigned `LineItemId` (UUID) required for removal. Sources:
- Populated automatically from any cart API response (`ActionCheckoutItem_Add`, `ActionCheckoutItem_Remove` both return the full cart including all `LineItemId` values)
- Also populated from `DataActionGetCartById` responses which fire automatically when the cart page loads during session initialisation

### Store identifiers

PLUS uses two distinct store identifiers, both captured passively during login:

| Field | Value | Source | Used in |
|---|---|---|---|
| `store_number` | `868` | `ActionStoreWrapper_GetGeneralDetails` → `Store.Store_Number` | `StoreNumber` param in promotions + product calls |
| `user_store_id` | `"913"` | `ActionCustomerTemp_GetDetails` → `PreferredStoreId` | `UserStoreId` param in promotions-list call |

`store_number` (868) is the public-facing identifier — it matches the trailing number in the store URL (`/supermarkten/burgum_plus-wolters_868`). This is the meaningful one for product availability: passing `StoreNumber: 868` in product/promotion requests causes the API to set `IsAvailable` per product based on stock at that specific store. All future product-fetching calls must pass this.

`user_store_id` (913) is an internal database record ID with no URL-visible form. `PreferredStoreNumber` and `PreferredStoreChannelId` on the same record are both empty — it is backend-only.

**Cart operations do not need a store ID.** The `CheckoutId` is bound to the account's preferred store server-side at checkout creation time. `ActionCheckoutItem_Add` takes only `CheckoutId`, `SKU`, `QuantityToAdd`, and `OneWelcomeUserId` — stock validation happens server-side against the associated store.

### Session state captured automatically at startup

After login + cart page navigation (no clicks), the following are known:
- `CheckoutId` — stable per user account
- `CheckoutVersion` — increments with every cart modification; always updated from API responses
- `OneWelcomeUserId` — user's identity provider UUID
- `moduleVersion` — module-level version hash
- `store_number` (868) — public store number; used in all product/promotion calls for stock filtering
- `user_store_id` ("913") — internal store record ID; used in promotions-list call
- `LineItemIds` for all current cart items (from response interception)
- `apiVersions` for Add/Remove/Get/Promotions/PromoDetail — from disk cache (`~/.config/shinyplus/api_versions.json`)

### `CheckoutVersion` (optimistic locking)

The server requires the client to send the current `CheckoutVersion` with every write. The server returns the new version in the response. Client always uses the latest received version. This prevents double-adds and race conditions — a fundamental improvement over the R implementation's `Sys.sleep`-based badge polling.

## Python stack

| Component | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Browser automation | **Playwright** (async) | Proper `async/await`, Chromium DevTools Protocol, request/response interception |
| HTTP client | **`page.evaluate(fetch(...))`** | Runs inside the browser page — inherits all cookies, Origin, Sec-Fetch-* headers automatically. Direct `httpx` calls return 403 due to OutSystems security checks |
| UI framework | **NiceGUI** (planned) | FastAPI + Vue/Quasar, WebSocket-based reactivity, async-native, drag-drop, modals |
| Data storage | **SQLite + SQLAlchemy Core** (planned) | Replaces per-user `.rds` binary files |
| Version cache | **JSON file** on disk | `~/.config/shinyplus/api_versions.json` |

### Why `page.evaluate(fetch(...))` and not `httpx`

Direct `httpx` calls return HTTP 403 even with the correct cookies and CSRF token. PLUS.nl's OutSystems backend validates `Origin`, `Referer`, and `Sec-Fetch-*` headers which only a real browser sets. Running the `fetch()` from inside the Playwright page context sets all these automatically.
